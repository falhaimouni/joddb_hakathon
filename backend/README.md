## 📈 Statistics & Calculations

### Productivity
```
Productivity = (Actual Output / Target Output) × 100
```

### Efficiency
```
Efficiency = (Standard Time / Actual Time) × 100
```

### Utilization
```
Utilization = (Productive Time / Available Time) × 100
```

**Work Schedule:**
- 9 hours total
- 8 working hours (480 minutes)
- 1 hour standard lunch (excluded from calculations)
- Extra breaks tracked and excluded
- Leave days reflected across all tables

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- PostgreSQL running on port 1616
- Database: `meow`

### Server Status
```bash
✅ Server running on: http://localhost:5000
✅ Health check: http://localhost:5000/health
✅ API info: http://localhost:5000/api
```

### Authentication Quickstart (JWT)
```bash
# 1) Login to receive a JWT
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/employees/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"employee_code":"E001","password":"YourPassword123!"}'

# Response contains: token, token_type (Bearer), expires_in

# 2) Call protected endpoints with the token
curl http://localhost:5000/api/employees/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <paste_token_here>"
```

### Quick Test
```bash
# Test server
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Create admin user
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/employees \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Admin","email":"admin@test.com","password":"admin123","role":"Admin"}'

# Generate password (requires Admin token)
curl http://localhost:5000/api/admin/generate-password \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>"
```
